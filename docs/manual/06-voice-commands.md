```

## Getting Started with Voice Commands

### Initial Voice Setup

```bash
# Enable voice recognition
neo voice enable

# Calibrate microphone
neo voice calibrate

# Set voice activation phrase
neo voice wake-word "Hey NEO"

# Test voice recognition
neo voice test
```

### Basic Voice Commands

#### System Control
```
"NEO, show system status"
"NEO, open calculator"
"NEO, lock the computer"
"NEO, what's the weather?"
```

#### File Operations
```
"NEO, create a new document called 'meeting notes'"
"NEO, find files modified today"
"NEO, backup my documents"
"NEO, delete temporary files"
```

#### Development Tasks
```
"NEO, create a Python project called 'data analyzer'"
"NEO, run unit tests"
"NEO, commit changes with message 'bug fixes'"
"NEO, deploy to staging"
```

## Advanced Voice Features

### Natural Language Processing

NEO understands complex, conversational commands:

```
# Instead of: "neo file create --name report.txt --type document"
"NEO, I need to create a report document for the quarterly meeting"

# Instead of: "neo system process --kill --name chrome"
"NEO, Chrome is using too much memory, please close it"

# Instead of: "neo security scan --type vulnerability --target network"
"NEO, can you check if our network has any security vulnerabilities?"
```

### Context Awareness

```
# Multi-turn conversations
User: "NEO, show me the sales data"
NEO: "Here's the sales data for this quarter. Would you like me to analyze trends?"
User: "Yes, and compare it to last year"
NEO: "Comparing current quarter to Q3 2023..."

# Contextual references
User: "NEO, create a backup of that database"
NEO: "Creating backup of the customer database we discussed earlier..."
```

### Voice Command Categories

#### 1. System Administration
```yaml
commands:
  system_status: "Show system performance and health"
  memory_usage: "Display RAM and storage usage"
  network_status: "Check network connectivity"
  service_management: "Start, stop, or restart services"
```

#### 2. Development Workflows
```yaml
commands:
  code_review: "Analyze code quality and suggest improvements"
  test_execution: "Run automated tests and report results"
  deployment: "Deploy applications to various environments"
  documentation: "Generate or update project documentation"
```

#### 3. Security Operations
```yaml
commands:
  vulnerability_scan: "Scan for security vulnerabilities"
  log_analysis: "Analyze system logs for anomalies"
  firewall_management: "Configure firewall rules"
  encryption: "Encrypt or decrypt files and communications"
```

## Voice Configuration

### Customizing Voice Recognition

```yaml
# ~/.neo/voice_config.yaml
voice_settings:
  wake_word: "Hey NEO"
  language: "en-US"
  accent_adaptation: true
  noise_cancellation: true
  sensitivity: 0.8
  
recognition:
  confidence_threshold: 0.75
  timeout_seconds: 5
  max_retry_attempts: 3
  
responses:
  voice_feedback: true
  response_speed: "normal"  # slow, normal, fast
  personality: "professional"  # casual, professional, technical
```

### Custom Voice Commands

```python
# custom_voice_commands.py
from neo.voice import VoiceCommand, VoiceResponse

@VoiceCommand("deploy my project")
def deploy_project():
    """Custom deployment command"""
    return VoiceResponse(
        action="deployment.start",
        params={"environment": "production"},
        response="Starting deployment to production environment"
    )

@VoiceCommand("analyze this code for bugs")
def code_analysis():
    """AI-powered code analysis"""
    return VoiceResponse(
        action="code.analyze",
        params={"type": "bug_detection"},
        response="Analyzing code for potential bugs and issues"
    )
```

## Voice Security & Privacy

### Security Features

```yaml
security:
  voice_authentication:
    enabled: true
    voice_print_verification: true
    multi_factor_required: false
    
  privacy:
    local_processing: true
    cloud_backup: false
    recording_retention: 7  # days
    
  permissions:
    system_commands: "voice_auth_required"
    file_operations: "password_required"
    network_access: "biometric_required"
```

### Voice Authentication Setup

```bash
# Create voice print
neo voice auth setup

# Verify identity
neo voice auth verify

# Enable voice-based 2FA
neo voice auth enable-2fa

# Set command permissions
neo voice permissions set --level admin
```

## Troubleshooting Voice Commands

### Common Issues

#### 1. Recognition Problems
```bash
# Check microphone
neo voice diagnose microphone

# Retrain voice model
neo voice retrain

# Adjust sensitivity
neo voice config sensitivity 0.9
```

#### 2. Command Execution Failures
```bash
# View command logs
neo voice logs --last 10

# Test specific commands
neo voice test-command "show system status"

# Reset voice engine
neo voice reset
```

#### 3. Performance Issues
```bash
# Optimize voice processing
neo voice optimize

# Check system resources
neo voice performance

# Update voice models
neo voice update-models
```

### Advanced Configuration

#### Multi-Language Support
```yaml
languages:
  primary: "en-US"
  secondary: ["es-ES", "fr-FR", "de-DE"]
  auto_detect: true
  translation: true
```

#### Voice Synthesis Customization
```yaml
synthesis:
  voice_type: "neural"  # standard, neural, custom
  speed: 1.0
  pitch: 1.0
  volume: 0.8
  emotion: "neutral"  # neutral, friendly, professional
```

## Voice Command Examples

### Project Management
```
"NEO, create a new project timeline for the Q4 release"
"NEO, schedule a code review for tomorrow at 2 PM"
"NEO, generate a status report for all active projects"
"NEO, remind me to update the documentation before Friday"
```

### Data Analysis
```
"NEO, analyze the sales trends from the last quarter"
"NEO, create a visualization of user engagement metrics"
"NEO, compare performance between different marketing campaigns"
"NEO, export the analysis results to a PowerPoint presentation"
```

### System Maintenance
```
"NEO, run a full system health check"
"NEO, clean up temporary files and optimize disk space"
"NEO, update all software packages and security patches"
"NEO, backup critical data to the cloud storage"
```

## Best Practices

### Effective Voice Communication

1. **Clear Pronunciation**: Speak clearly and at moderate pace
2. **Specific Commands**: Use precise language for better recognition
3. **Context Building**: Provide context for complex requests
4. **Confirmation**: Always confirm critical operations

### Command Structure Tips

```
# Good examples:
"NEO, create a Python script to analyze CSV data"
"NEO, find all PDF files modified in the last week"
"NEO, start the development server on port 3000"

# Avoid:
"NEO, do something with files"
"NEO, make it work"
"NEO, fix the problem"
```
